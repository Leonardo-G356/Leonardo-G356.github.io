                <h2>Our Farm's History</h2>
                <p>
                    The story of Pumpkin Patch & Co. began in the early 1970s, when our grandparents, Margaret and Thomas Walker, turned a small corner of their family farm into a humble pumpkin patch. What started as a few rows of pumpkins quickly grew, year after year, fueled by the smiles of local families and the joy of autumn traditions. Over time, the farm expanded to include a corn maze, hayrides, homemade goods, and a gathering space where new memories could be made every season. Though the world around us has changed, we’ve stayed true to the simple values that built our farm — hard work, hospitality, and a love for the harvest. Today, Pumpkin Patch & Co. stands as a living piece of our family's heritage, and we’re honored to share it with you.</p>

                <h2>Our Family Story</h2>
                <p>Pumpkin Patch & Co. grew from the dreams of our grandparents, who planted the very first seeds over fifty years ago. They believed that a simple pumpkin could bring people together — and they were right. What began as a small patch for friends and neighbors quickly became a gathering place for families across the community. Today, we proudly carry on their tradition, with three generations working side-by-side to welcome you to our farm. Every pumpkin in the field, every homemade pie, every hayride under the golden sun — it's all crafted with the same love and care that started it all. When you visit Pumpkin Patch & Co., you're not just a guest — you become part of our family story, a story that's still growing with every smile, every laugh, and every fall memory made.</p>
